# ☕Coffee Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project centers around the analysis of coffee order data to uncover patterns in customer behavior, product preferences, and sales performance across regions. 

## Objective
The objective is to deliver actionable insights that enhance customer targeting and improve revenue generation strategies. 

## Insights
* Excelsa, Liberica, and Arabica dominate sales
  * Account for over 85% of total sales, clearly preferred over Robusta.

* Light roast is the top-performing roast
  * With over $17.3k in sales, Light Roast significantly outpaces Medium and Dark, suggesting a strong customer preference.

* Loyalty card users contribute less per order
  * Non-loyalty users: $46.48 avg order
  * Loyalty users: $43.67 avg order
  * Loyalty customers spend less per transaction, despite being repeat buyers — this could signal an opportunity to revamp the loyalty program.

* The U.S. is the primary revenue driver
  * The United States leads by a large margin in total coffee sales, making it the core market.

## Recommendations
* Double Down on Best-Selling Coffee Types- Prioritise offers, inventory around Excelsa, Liberica, and Arabica.

* Revamp the Loyalty Program to Boost Spend.
